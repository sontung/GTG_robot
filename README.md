Finalize project.

## 28th Mar, 2015

First complete attempt on avoid obstacles implementation. Test with the bot, everything works fine. Need higher dangerous level though.

## 8th Mar, 2015

Intel Galileo has its own voltage regulator. So any voltage from 7 to 12 can be used to feed it.

An update on what causes the sensor problem. That is the motor shield, when the shield is disattached 
Serial monitor reads same range of values.

## 14th Feb, 2015

Test suites have been developed, including sensors, motors. An attempt to implement
a simple avoid-obstacles has been made but not been tested because of the lack of a portable
power supply.  
**Problems encountered:**  
- lack of portable power supply
- sensors displays different ranges of values on different analog ports of the board
